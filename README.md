## Julien Robine | Putting data at good use ✊
#### Data analyst for a left-wing political party 🌹  

Self-taught and passionate about data, I continue to learn programming, mathematics, and statistics.  
I pay attention to put my skills at use for meaningful projects, first in development of sport accessibility, and now for an ecological and social future.  

I remain available for any committed project that will spark my curiosity.
